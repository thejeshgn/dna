gs141	3.5	Bad		2x risk of Alzheimer's disease	You carry one APOE-&#949;3 allele and one APOE-&#949;4 allele. This results in 2x increased relative risk of Alzheimer's disease. For non-caucasians the risk is increased, but SNPedia has not yet seen any reliable estimates. This is based on *rs429358(C;T) *rs7412(C;C)
gs152	3.5	Bad		CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizer	CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizer. Your body breaks down some medicines more slowly than most people. As a result, you may need a lower than average dosage of the medicines metabolized by CYP2C19 in order to decrease adverse effects, or a higher than average dose to increase efficacy of drugs that require metabolization by CYP2C19 to become active. One example of a drug requiring bioconversion by CYP2C19 is Clopidogrel (Plavix); CYP2C19 poor metabolizers may require higher Clopidogrel dosing or the use of another thienopyridine such as prasugrel.[http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/302/8/849]

rs10033464(G;T)	3.0	Bad	15.9%	1.28x increased risk of Atrial Fibrillation and cardioembolic stroke.	1.28x increased risk of Atrial Fibrillation and cardioembolic stroke.  This is one copy of a mutant version (and one of the normal version) which slightly affects the formation of the heart and makes people slightly more likely to get Atrial Fibrillation (quivering of the top chambers of the heart caused by chaotic electrical signals) and slightly more likely to have a cardioembolic stroke (blocked blood flow to the brain). But also check the other SNP nearby (rs2200733) which affects Atrial Fibrillation even more. 23andMe gave this a 4 star confidence rating as it has been heavily studied. It has been confirmed in Europeans.

rs53576(A;G)	2.8	Bad	None	lack of empathy?	lack of empathy?  You have a SNP in the oxytocin receptor which may make you less empathetic than most people. When under stress you may have more difficulty recognizing the emotional state of others which impacts loneliness, parenting, and socializing skills. Some studies have suggested that the A;G genotype is associated with an intermediate level of empathy (compared to the G;G and A;A genotypes), although most report that A;G and A;A individuals have similar levels of empathy and stress handling capabilities.
rs6983267(G;T)	2.7	Bad	54.9%	1.3x risk of prostate cancer; aspirin reduces risk of colorectal cancer	1.3x risk of prostate cancer; aspirin reduces risk of colorectal cancer  Increased risk for prostate cancer and in women other types of cancer. Aspirin has been reported to help reduce the risk somewhat when taken by carriers of this genotype.
gs157	2.5			more stimulated by coffee	You appear to have a common genotype in the gene CYP1A2 which metabolizes coffee more slowly than some other forms. The same amount of caffeine will tend to have more stimulating effect on slow metabolizers than on fast metabolizers. Ciprofloxacin is also metabolized by CYP1A2, but is unclear if your genotype should influence its effect.
gs250	2.5	Bad		Normal Parkinson's Disease Risk	The (G;G) genotype at this position is considered protective against Parkinson's Disease, but you don't have it. You instead have the more common rs10513789(T;T) which does not reduce your risk. see also gs249 for the more common heterozygote form http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2012/06/01/patenting-and-personal-genomics-23andme-receives-its-first-patent-and-plenty-of-questions/
gs256	2.5			Blue eyes	thumb Heterozygous for what calls blue eye color haplotype #1. It seems 'blue', might be overstating it.

gs221	2.0	Bad		Autoimmune disorder risk in Europeans	This genoset tags the DQ2.2 haplotype in Europeans, and thus increased risk gluten intolerance and for autoimmune disorders such as celiac disease.
gs276	2.0	Bad		Slightly increased risk (17.2% of white women) of Atrial Fibrillation in the 2 SNPs mentioned by 23andMe.	The less important of the two atrial fibrillation SNPs mentioned by 23andMe has one defective copy. This slightly affects the formation of the heart and slightly increases risk of Atrial Fibrillation (quivering of the top part of the heart) that 23andMe reports. It also seems to slightly increase the risk of Cardioembolic ischemic stroke (blocked blood flow to the brain) although 23andMe doesn't mention that. For European women, 23andMe reports this as a 17.2% risk, compared to the 15.9% average. The risk is higher for men. Based on many quality studies, and confirmed for Europeans. It's recommended to eat a heart-healthy diet, and only drink alcohol in moderation, to lower the risk.

Mothers homozygous for this variant were found in a few studies to have an increased risk for Down syndrome babies (risk of 0.4%, average risk in population is 0.25%), but other studies (including in Italian, Irish, French, and Indian-Gujarati women) found no increased risk. Notably, age plays a far larger role in the rate of Down syndrome (risk is 4.5% for a mother 45-years-of-age), and, it is unknown how this variant may combine with the effect of age. There are conflicting reports associating this variant with incidence of neural tube defects, p...

Associated with: Restless legs syndrome. This SNP, located in an intron of the BTBD9 gene, has a variant that is seen somewhat more frequently in individuals with restless legs syndrome. The risk allele is rs3923809(A); carriers of two such alleles, i.e. those with rs3923809(A;A) genotypes, are estimated to be 1.9 fold more likely to have restless legs syndrome than rs3923809(G;G) individuals. The authors of this study suggest that perhaps half of the cases of restless legs syndrome may involve the rs3923809 risk genotypes.

Alcohol Flush: Normal, doesn't flush. Normal hangovers. Normal risk of Alcoholism. Normal risk of Esophageal Cancer. Disulfiram is effective for alcoholism.  Two working copies of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH2) mean you won't turn bright red when you drink alcohol, unlike most Asians. After your body turns alcohol into the dangerous acetaldehyde, this gene quickly turns the acetaldehyde into vinegar. It also stops the acetaldehyde in cigarettes from causing Esophageal Cancer. It reduces hangovers compared to Asians, but less hangovers and flushing obviously increases the risk of alcoholism. Alcoholism can be treated effectively with the drug Disulfiram (Antabuse) which would stop this gene from working and cause the Asian flush in non-Asians.

gs140	1.7			NAT2 slow metabolizer	Most non-Scandinavian Caucasians and approximately half of African-Americans are slow metabolizers. This variation is important because of its primary role in the deactivation of many chemicals in the body's environment, including those produced by caffeine and cigarettes as well as aromatic amine and hydrazine drugs used medicinally. In general, slow metabolizers have higher rates of certain types of cancer and are more susceptible to side effects from chemicals metabolized by NAT2. According to this source 6 snps determine NAT2 metabolism. The way their genotypes interact is very complex, which makes this one of the largest genosets in SNPedia.

Depending on your other SNPs, this might cause the inability to taste the bitterness of phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and similar molecules in foods (like cabbage and raw broccoli) or drinks (like coffee and dark beers). That would make cabbage etc. taste horribly bland and boring. On the other hand, fruit from the tropical bignay tree would taste unpleasantly bitter to you instead of sweet. You might eat less healthily.

rs1861046(G;G)	1.0		92.9%		Conduct disorder (CD) is one of the most prevalent childhood psychiatric conditions, and is associated with a number of serious concomitant and future problems. CD symptomatology is known to have a considerable genetic component, with heritability estimates in the range of 50%. Four SNPs reached genome-wide significance with CD symptom count, based on P &lt; 5x10^-8 Two of these SNPs (rs16891867 and rs1861046) were in the gene C1QTNF7 (C1q and tumor necrosis factor-related protein 7). These SNPs were in high LD (r^2=0.97). The other top two SNPs meeting genome-wide significance were intergenic and located on chromosomes 11 and 13. Alleles A/G were found to be associated with CD symptom count or CD case status. [http://www.downstate.edu/hbnl/documents/2010-Dick-Genome-wideassociationstudyof...
